Ensure aff4-cpp-lite is installed on your system according to their install instructions.
Once installed run the following on the command line:

g++ -Wall aff4fuse.cpp -I/usr/include/fuse3 -lfuse3 -lpthread  -laff4 -o aff4mount

This will produce an aff4mount executable which you can copy to your /usr/local/bin/
